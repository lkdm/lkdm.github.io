<h1 class="title">Build and automate your toolbox</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-02-24</strong></p>
<p>For years I've kept my machines somewhat in sync with a sparse group of dotfiles in a git repository. I have been doing what most people do, and writing a setup script to symlink them to the correct spots.</p>
<p>This works somewhat well, but it necessitates that I manually symlink the dotfiles to the correct locations.</p>
<p>The problem with this setup started when I was unceremoniously handed a laptop with Windows pre-installed instead of a Mac at my most recent role. I can't stand Windows, and besides have very little experience trying to shoehown a POSIX development environment onto it, so I was determined to give Linux a try.</p>
<p>Luckily my employers were understanding and supportive, and so I booted up Ubuntu and pulled down my dotfiles.</p>
<p>After some teething issues, I fixed a bunch of things with my configuration. But this caused a few issues;</p>
<ol>
<li>The packages I had installed on my personal Mac and my work computer were different.</li>
<li>The dotfiles sparsely covered the system, giving a lot of room for problems.</li>
<li>Differences in shell and system led to problems.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-you-absolutely-should-automate-your-toolbox">Why you absolutely should automate your toolbox</h2>
<h3 id="to-master-your-tools">To master your tools</h3>
<p>If you are a software engineer, you are likely to be doing this job for a long time. Conservatively, years, but likely for decades.</p>
<p>Learning the same set of tools really, really well is an investment into yourself.</p>
<h3 id="to-keep-context-switching-minimal">To keep context switching minimal</h3>
<p>I love programming, and sometimes race home from work with a great idea that I just <em>need</em> to code. Having a personal dev environment that is radically different than my work dev environment was a show stopper every time.</p>
<h3 id="be-productive-even-in-the-face-of-disruptions">Be productive, even in the face of disruptions</h3>
<p>Our physical reality is unpredictable. You should backup your data, and this includes the state of your machine. You should expect disruptions, and you should be able to have a productive day even if your computer dies and you need to quickly use another one.</p>
<h2 id="quick-selection-of-tools">Quick selection of tools</h2>
<p>Here is my reasoning for some of the tools I've chosen:</p>
<h3 id="zsh">Zsh</h3>
<p>I've chosen <code>zsh</code> as a shell because it has some great features, and comes default on Mac OS systems. I use mine without <code>oh-my-zsh</code>, which although popular and great, slows down the response time in the terminal too much for my liking. It should be snappy!</p>
<h2 id="how-i-automated-my-toolbox">How I automated my toolbox</h2>
<h3 id="use-a-dotfiles-git-repository">Use a dotfiles git repository</h3>
<p>If you haven't already, create a remote git repository (on a Git platform such as GitLab, BitBucket or GitHub), call it <code>dotfiles</code> or something similar, and clone it to your computer.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#bf616a;">git</span><span> clone git@github.com:USER/dotfiles.git
</span></code></pre>
<p>I like to mirror the git URL on my computer:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#96b5b4;">cd </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">~</span><span>/github.com/USER/dotfiles/
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then create a symbolic link</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#bf616a;">ln -s ~</span><span>/github.com/USER/dotfiles/.zshrc </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">~</span><span>/.zshrc
</span></code></pre>
<p>While this is all you technically need to get started with dotfiles, we can do a lot better.</p>
<h3 id="use-chezmoi">Use chezmoi</h3>
<h4 id="variances-across-systems">Variances across systems</h4>
<h4 id="use-a-password-manager-for-secrets">Use a password manager for secrets</h4>
<h4 id="install-nerdfonts">Install nerdfonts</h4>
<p>The first thing I used to do when setting up any new system was go and install a NerdFont, this was always mildly painful because in addition to downloading the font, I'd have to figure out where to put the file, then hope that past-me remembered to put the configuration files that reference them on git.</p>
<p>Chezmoi lets you write a script that <a href="https://github.com/lkdm/dotfiles/blob/main/.chezmoiexternal.toml.tmpl">automatically</a> installs them to the correct location.</p>
<h3 id="use-atuin">Use atuin</h3>
<p>Some developers actually sync their <code>.bash_history</code> file.</p>
<p>I personally use <code>atuin</code> which is a cli utility that stores shell history in a SQLite file. It can also sync to an encrypted db on the cloud, for free.</p>
<p>I love it. Now that my entire config is in sync, syncing my shell history helps me rediscover shell commands that I've used to complete various things.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://github.com/lkdm/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_config/atuin/config.toml">dotfile</a> for atuin that keeps the configuration in sync.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-script-to-install-packages">Use a script to install packages</h3>
<p>I still haven't arrived on a great way to keep packages synced across my systems.</p>
<p>At the moment I've settled on this <a href="https://github.com/lkdm/dotfiles/blob/main/run_onchange_setup.sh.tmpl">behemoth</a> of a script that lets me declare packages in different managers across systems.</p>
<p>I'm also looking into the feasability of using <a href="https://github.com/lkdm/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_brewfiles/Brewfile.tmpl">Homebrew's Brewfiles</a>.</p>
<p>I've even looked into using Nix and <a href="https://devenv.sh/">devenv.sh</a> for package management, but decided against is because I feel like learning these tools would be like a second job. My current setup just works.</p>
